# Face-Detection
This project demonstrates **real-time face detection in the browser** using [OpenCV.js](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html) compiled to WebAssembly (WASM). Detected faces are extracted from the video stream and displayed as downloadable images â€” simply click on a detected face to download it!  ---
